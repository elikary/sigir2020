## Evaluation

For the evaluation stage we developed some scripts to run evaluation on each of the datasets we used.
To run the evaluation scripts go to `sigir2020/FP_metrics` and run the following command:

    python main.py

NOTE: To run scripts in unix systems, you need to assign the right persmissions to each file.

    chmod +x <scriptname>
to grant execute permission to each script

### System Requirements

The recommended way to setup a working python environment is to use Anaconda distribution https://www.continuum.io/downloads.
Here is also a list of required packages:

- Python 3.7.1
